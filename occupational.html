                <h3>Learn Occupational Health Card</h3>
                <p>An Occupational Health Card, often abbreviated as OHC, is a document or certification that verifies 
                an individual's fitness and health status for specific job roles or occupations, particularly in 
                industries or professions where occupational health and safety are of paramount importance. 
                Occupational Health Cards are usually issued to employees or workers who are exposed to potential 
                workplace hazards, such as chemicals, physical risks, or biological agents.
                <br><br>
                To obtain an Occupational Health Card, an individual typically undergoes a comprehensive health and 
                safety assessment. This assessment may include medical examinations, tests, and screenings to evaluate 
                the individual's physical and mental health, as well as their fitness to perform specific job duties 
                safely.
                Occupational Health Cards are often job-specific, meaning they are issued based on the nature of the 
                occupation and the potential health risks associated with it. Different job roles may have varying 
                health requirements, and individuals are assessed accordingly.
                The specific health assessments required for an Occupational Health Card depend on the occupation 
                and potential risks. They may include physical examinations, lung function tests, vision and hearing 
                tests, blood tests, and other relevant evaluations.
                Occupational Health Cards are typically valid for a specified period, after which the individual may 
                need to undergo a new health assessment to renew the card. The validity period varies based on the 
                occupation and local regulations.
                <br><br>
                In many countries, certain occupations, particularly those in high-risk industries like construction, 
                healthcare, manufacturing, and mining, legally require employees to hold an Occupational Health Card 
                as part of workplace safety regulations.
                Occupational Health Cards play a significant role in preventing workplace accidents and health-related 
                incidents by ensuring that employees are physically and mentally capable of performing their job 
                duties without undue risk to their health and safety.
                As part of the Occupational Health Card process, individuals may receive training and education on 
                workplace safety and the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
                Issuance and regulation of Occupational Health Cards are often overseen by government agencies 
                responsible for labor and occupational safety. These agencies establish standards and guidelines for 
                the issuance and renewal of these cards.
