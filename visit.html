                <h3>Learn Visit Visa</h3>
                <p>A visit visa, also commonly known as a tourist visa or a visitor visa, is a type of temporary visa 
                that allows individuals to enter a foreign country for a specified period, primarily for leisure, 
                tourism, visiting family or friends, or attending short-term business meetings. Visit visas are 
                typically non-immigrant visas, meaning they do not confer the right to live, work, or study in the 
                host country permanently. Instead, they are designed for individuals who plan to stay in the 
                country for a limited duration and then return to their home country.
                <br><br>
                Visit visas are commonly used by tourists to explore a foreign country's culture, attractions, and 
                natural beauty. Tourists can visit landmarks, engage in recreational activities, and experience the 
                local way of life.
                Visit visas are also used by individuals who want to visit family members or friends residing in 
                another country. This allows for family reunions and social visits.
                Some countries offer visit visas for business travelers who intend to attend conferences, meetings, or 
                negotiations. These visas are often referred to as business visitor visas.
                The duration of a visit visa can vary from a few days to several months, depending on the host 
                country's regulations and the specific type of visit visa. Extensions may be possible in some cases.
                <br><br>
                Visit visa holders are typically prohibited from engaging in employment, academic studies, or any 
                activity that generates income in the host country. Violating these restrictions can lead to legal 
                consequences, including deportation.
                Applying for a visit visa usually involves submitting an application to the host country's 
                embassy or consulate, providing necessary documentation, including a valid passport, proof of 
                sufficient funds for the visit, and sometimes proof of accommodation and return flight reservations.
                There is usually an application fee associated with visit visas, which varies depending on the host 
                country and the specific visa type.
                Some countries have visa waiver agreements with certain other countries, allowing citizens of those 
                countries to enter without a visit visa for short stays. The duration and conditions of visa waiver 
                agreements vary.
                Visit visa holders must adhere to the approved period of stay and must leave the host country before 
                the visa's expiration to avoid overstaying, which can lead to penalties and future visa restrictions.
