                <h3>Learn Tenancy Contract</h3>
                <p>A tenancy contract, also known as a lease agreement or rental agreement, is a legally binding 
                document that outlines the terms and conditions governing the rental of residential or commercial 
                property. This contract is signed by a landlord (property owner or lessor) and a tenant 
                (renter or lessee) to specify their respective rights and obligations during the rental period. 
                The tenancy contract serves to protect the interests of both parties and provides clarity 
                regarding the use, occupation, and maintenance of the leased property.
                <br><br>
                The contract starts by identifying the landlord and tenant by their full legal names, addresses, and 
                contact details.
                The contract describes the rented property, including its location, type (e.g., apartment, house, 
                office space), and any specific details that are relevant to the lease.
                The contract specifies the duration of the lease, including the start and end dates. It can be for a 
                fixed term (e.g., one year) or on a month-to-month basis.
                The monthly rent amount, the due date for rent payments, and the method of payment (e.g., bank transfer,
                check) are outlined in the contract. It may also include details about security deposits and advance 
                rent payments.
                The contract may specify which utilities (water, electricity, gas, internet, etc.) are included in the 
                rent and who is responsible for maintenance and repairs of the property.
                This section details the rules and expectations for the use of the property. It may cover issues such 
                as pets, smoking, subletting, property alterations, and other restrictions.
                <br><br>
                The contract typically outlines the notice period required by either party for termination or renewal 
                of the lease.
                The contract may specify the amount of the security deposit, conditions for its return, and any 
                deductions that can be made.
                The contract may include legal provisions that define the rights and obligations of both parties, as
                well as any applicable local, state, or national laws governing tenancy.
                Both the landlord and tenant must sign and date the contract to make it legally binding.
